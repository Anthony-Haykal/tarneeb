Card Images Directory

This directory should contain images for all 52 playing cards in a standard deck plus the card back.

Expected filenames:
- For cards: "{rank}_of_{suit}.png" (e.g., "A_of_spades.png", "10_of_hearts.png")
- For card back: "card_back.png"

Ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
Suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades

If card images are not provided, the game will automatically generate simple card placeholders.
